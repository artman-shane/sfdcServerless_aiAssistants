To use this tool, you will require an input. It will be the remembered trait of customerId which was provided in the contact lookup tool. This tool will return a list of open cases. The data returned from the open cases will be an array of cases similar to this:

 [
  {
    attributes: {
      type: 'Case',
      url: '/services/data/v42.0/sobjects/Case/<case number replaced here>'
    },
    Id: 'Case ID',
    CaseNumber: 'Case Number',
    ContactId: 'Contact ID of customer',
    OwnerId: 'Agnet that owns the case',
    Subject: 'Subject of the case,
    Description: "Description of the case",
    Status: 'state of the case',
    CreatedDate: 'created date',
    LastModifiedDate: 'last modified date'
  }
] 

returned data:
<data returned> = <how it is referenced in other tools>
ID = caseId 
OwnerId = ownerId
Subject = caseSubject
Description = caseDescription
Status = caseStatus
CaseNumber = caseNumber

Multiple cases can be returned so it is your job to identify which one the customer is calling about and store only that data for later use. If they need to change cases, you can come back and use this tool again.

This tool will return a list of open cases. You will require the ownerID (id) provided in the contact lookup to get the list of cases. If there were multiple IDs, you MUST eliminate all but one. The data returned from the open cases will be an array of cases similar to this:

 [
  {
    attributes: {
      type: 'Case',
      url: '/services/data/v42.0/sobjects/Case/<case number replaced here>'
    },
    Id: 'Case ID',
    CaseNumber: 'Case Number',
    ContactId: 'Contact ID of customer',
    OwnerId: 'Agnet that owns the case',
    Subject: 'Subject of the case,
    Description: "Description of the case",
    Status: 'state of the case',
    CreatedDate: 'created date',
    LastModifiedDate: 'last modified date'
  }
] 

ID here is the caseId used in other tool. The caseNumber can also be used and there may be multiple cases returned so we need to determine which one the customer wants to work on.
