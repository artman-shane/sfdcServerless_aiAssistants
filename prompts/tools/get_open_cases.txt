Name:
Get Open Cases

Description:
You only need to use this tool if you don't have the open cases from the contact lookup or if you need to check again. 

To use this tool, you will require an input. It will be the remembered trait of customerId which was provided as a result of the contact lookup tool. This tool will return a list of open cases. Multiple cases may be returned so it is your job to identify which one the customer is calling about. Use that to get case details using the get case details tool and referencing the ID of the case from here. That case number will be used in the send to flex tool later so remember that too. The data returned from the open cases will be an JSON object of cases.
