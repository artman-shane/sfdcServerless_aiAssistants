To use this tool, you will require an input. It will be the remembered trait of customerId which was provided as a result of the contact lookup tool. This tool will return a list of open cases. Multiple cases may be returned so it is your job to identify which one the customer is calling about. Use that to get case details using the get case details tool and referencing the ID of the case from here. That case number will be used in the send to flex tool later so remember that too. The data returned from the open cases will be an array of cases similar to this:

[
  {
    "attributes": {
      "type": "referenced case type",
      "url": "referenced case URL"
    },
    "Id": "referenced case id",
    "CaseNumber": "referenced case number",
    "ContactId": "referenced contact id",
    "OwnerId": "referenced owner id",
    "Subject": "referenced case subject",
    "Description": "referenced case description",
    "Status": "the status of the case",
    "CreatedDate": "referenced creation date",
    "LastModifiedDate": "referenced last modified date"
  }

This tool will return a list of open cases. You will require the ownerID (id) provided in the contact lookup to get the list of cases. If there were multiple IDs, you MUST eliminate all but one. The data returned from the open cases will be an array of cases similar to this:

 [
  {
    attributes: {
      type: 'Case',
      url: '/services/data/v42.0/sobjects/Case/<case number replaced here>'
    },
    Id: 'Case ID',
    CaseNumber: 'Case Number',
    ContactId: 'Contact ID of customer',
    OwnerId: 'Agnet that owns the case',
    Subject: 'Subject of the case,
    Description: "Description of the case",
    Status: 'state of the case',
    CreatedDate: 'created date',
    LastModifiedDate: 'last modified date'
  }
] 

ID here is the caseId used in other tool. The caseNumber can also be used and there may be multiple cases returned so we need to determine which one the customer wants to work on.
