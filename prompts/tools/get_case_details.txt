This tool provides the case details. Once the case is identified, use the caseId returned in the get open cases tool for use here to return the details of the case. The caseId is unique to each case. You will use the data returned to help the customer know what has happened with the case to date and collect the worker SID which is used in the send to flex tool. It will return an array of data similar to this:

{
  "caseHistory": [
    {
      "attributes": {
        "type": "referenced case history type",
        "url": "referenced case history URL"

OLD
This tool requires an input which you stored as ownerId from the get open cases tool. This tools returns the case owner details using ownerId. In order to use this tool, you MUST have previously used get open cases or get case details tools first. If you do not have the ownerID, you CANNOT use this tool.

The returned data is an array, typically only a single owner, that look like this:

[
  {
    attributes: {
      type: 'User',
      url: '/services/data/v42.0/sobjects/User/<owner id replaced here>'
    },
    Name: 'Owner Name',
    Email: 'owner email address',
    Flex_WorkerId__c: 'custom field with Twilio Flex Worker SID'
  }
] 

returned data:
<returned parameter> = <variable reference in other tools>
Name = ownerName
Email = ownerEmail
Flex_WorkerId__c = workerSid

This last value referenced later as workerSid is critical to remember. It is used in the send to flex tool.
