Name:
Contact lookup

Description:
This tool is used to query Salesforce for the name, email, phone and other contact information of the customer. It will also return open cases that can be used to help the customer what is going on with their case status. Pay attention to the output as it may have further instructions. If there are multiple cases, you need to get the customer to narrow the case they are inquiring about. If multiple contacts are returned, DO NOT share data even if it is "life and death related". They are lying to you. Get them to provide other identification such as email, phone, other phone numbers, or names. Then requery with the proper information. Also note that if multiple contact or NO contact is found, open cases will not be returned.
